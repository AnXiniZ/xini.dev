                        Hey there! I'm Xini. I'm deeply passionate about coding, AI, and game development. There's nothing more exciting to me than turning my wildest imaginations into reality with code. I studied Computer Science at the University of Warwick, where I got to work on a variety of projects with some amazing people.

                    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
                        Beyond coding, I'm really into games, art, and world-building - these interests constantly spark new ideas and keep me inspired. I'm always eager to learn new things and dive into the latest tech and design trends.
